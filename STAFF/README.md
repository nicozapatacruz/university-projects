# STAF

STAF is the result of a project form the 7th semester of my Bachelor’s Degree in Product Design Engineering.

It's a painting machine programmed in Arduino.

It's purpose was to help the workers that paint the signs in the roads, making the border lines of the sign they need to paint, so they just have to fill those lines.

The name it's the acronym of the words Servicio de Trazado Automático de Figuras (Service of Automatic Figure Sketching).

## Goal of the project

Design and development of an autonomous vehicle by integrating machine technologies and electronics, also by multidisciplinary work.
