# University Projects

Here are some projects of coding I made during my time in time in the university in 1 semester of Computer Science and the Product Design Engineering Bachelor's Degree.

## Rubik Cube

This project was made in 2016 in BlueJ - Java. The purpose of the project was to make a digital 2D Rubik Cube.

## STAF

STAF is the result of a project form the 7th semester of my bachelor degree in Product Design Engineering.

It's a painting machine programmed in Arduino.

It's purpose was to help the workers that paint the signs in the roads, making the border lines of the sign they need to paint, so they just have to fill those lines.
